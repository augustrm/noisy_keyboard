# noisy keyboard
### Shell script that makes your digital typing experience objectively worse

This script plays a typewriter sample whenever you hit a key.

Written on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

EASILY alterable to play ANY .wav file you so desire.

Depends on xinput, sed, and ALSA "aplay".

This project is not "finished" and likely never will be.

It is totally unstable on any machine other than the one it was created on (keymaps WILL vary from machine to machine), so be ready to rewrite some stuff.
